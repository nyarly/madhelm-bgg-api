# BGG JSON API

While BGG has an API, it has drawbacks and requirements.
The responses are all in XML,
there's actually two separate APIs,
and the older one hasn't been entirely translated to the new one.
Furthermore,
the XMLAPIs require an authentication token for the backend,
which is scoped to the whole application,
so it can't be safely pushed into the frontend.
Finally,
BGG is trying to keep their services from being
hit too hard by 3rd party apps,
so they encourage local caching of data
and rate limit requests.

This gateway tries to address all of these concerns.
It
serves as a custodian of application access tokens,
consumes the raw XML,
stores data it sees for later reuse.
It also
authenticates requests
as being generated by a known application,
so that we can preserve our rate limit consumption.
